            The role of the  IT Governance Review Board (GRB) is to ensure  IT Investments are a good use of CMS resources, meeting business needs at acceptable costs. The Governance Review Board consists of CMS Budget Development Group Chairs and representatives who make CMS project funding recommendations to the Administrator, as well as the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Chief Information Officer (CIO), Chief Technology Officer (CTO), and Head of Contracting Activity.
          </p>

          >
            During the session, you will talk through your Business Case with the board members and how the approval of your project will help benefit CMS programs. You’ll need to talk through how you arrived at the costs in your Business Case and the assumptions you made when calculating them. Next, the GRB will review your proposed alternatives and their pros and cons.
