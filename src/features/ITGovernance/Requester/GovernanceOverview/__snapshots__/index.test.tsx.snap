      The EASi IT Governance process connects you with the resources, people and services that you need in order to request a CMS Life Cycle ID and get approval for your project or IT expenditure. The Intake Request form is the first step in the overall process and will provide the Governance Admin Team with a brief budgetary, contractual, and conceptual overview of your project. Upon submission of the Intake Request form, you will receive an automatic email from EASi, and a Governance Admin Team member will soon follow up regarding next steps. Listed below is an overview of all the steps involved in the IT Governance process.

              Depending on the complexity of your request and the costs involved, the Governance Admin Team may ask that you get approval from the GRB. This may be completed asynchronously within EASi, or they may ask you to present your Business Case at a GRB meeting. The GRB will discuss and make decisions based on any or all of the following: your Intake Request, business need, Business Case, and recommendations from the GRT.

              Depending on the complexity of your request and the costs involved, the Governance Admin Team may ask that you get approval from the GRB. This may be completed asynchronously within EASi, or they may ask you to present your Business Case at a GRB meeting. The GRB will discuss and make decisions based on any or all of the following: your Intake Request, business need, Business Case, and recommendations from the GRT.
