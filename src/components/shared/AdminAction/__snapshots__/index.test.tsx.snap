      Review the initial request form. If this request is ready to move on to a consult session, please mark it as ready. If the TRB needs further information in order to proceed, you may request edits or additional information from the project team.
    </p>
    What should I consider when reviewing the initial request form?
    <ul>
      <li>
        Is the support requested clear, i.e. design review vs. problem-solving?
      </li>
      <li>
        If the customer is asking for assistance in solving a problem, is the problem definition clear?
      </li>
      <li>
        Is the stated scope of the changes to the project clear?
      </li>
      <li>
        If the scope is clear, are the architecture changes minor (i..e. simple or straightforward)?
      </li>
      <li>
        Is there enough information available to determine which SMEs are needed?
      </li>
      <li>
        Has the project been to a TRB consult session before?
      </li>
      <li>
        If the project has been to a TRB consult session before, are the stakeholders, and the contractor the same as those that attended before?
      </li>
    </ul>
