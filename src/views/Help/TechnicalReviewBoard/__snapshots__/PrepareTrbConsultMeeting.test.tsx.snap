      The CMS Technical Review Board (TRB) is a technical assistance resource for project teams across the agency at all stages of their system’s life cycle. It offers consultations and reviews on an ongoing or one-off basis, allowing project teams to consult with a cross-functional team of technical advisors. It also guides project teams on adhering to CMS technical standards and leveraging existing technologies.
