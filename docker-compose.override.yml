      # Volume mounting the entire './' directory is dangerous, as it mounts OS-specific folders (and things like .git)

      # Note, however, that MOST of the files that we care about are copied in the Dockerfile for us, we only really need to copy over the things that
      # we want to be able to change on the fly in local developmement, like our ./pkg/ directory & Air configs.
      # This means that editing things like your go.mod/go.sum and ./cmd/ directory WILL require a rebuild of the image, and won't hot reload with Air.

      # The only reason we need to mount Cypress here is because the `flagdata.json` (used when FLAG_SOURCE=FILE) happens to live in the ./cypress/ directory.
      # This is not ideal (perhaps it should be in the root directory?), but for now we just volume mount cypress as a workaround.
      # NOTE: This is only really the case if you set FLAG_SOURCE=FILE locally, or (more importantly) in ./docker-compose-cypress_ci.yml
