# CMS EASi Application

This repository contains the application code
for the CMS EASi (Easy Access to System Information).

## Application Setup

### Setup: Yarn (temporary)

Run `brew install yarn` to install yarn.
Run `yarn install` to install dependencies.

This is temporary for setting up pre-commit package,
until we decide how to structure our CLI tools.

### Setup: Pre-Commit

Run `pre-commit install`
to install a pre-commit hook
into `./git/hooks/pre-commit`.
This is different than `brew install pre-commit`
and must be done
so that the hook will check files
you are about to commit to the repository.
Next install the pre-commit hook libraries
with `pre-commit install-hooks`.
